        Configuration for the AlphaBlitz Game.
-->

<config>
<!--
     autoMove tells WebDFS whther or not to automatically move data
     when the configs change and a GET cannot find data.
     if this value evaluates to true, then whenever WebDFS cannot find
     a file for a GET request, it will look in the old location (if there is an old location)
     and if it can find it there it will move it from the
     old location to the new location and return the image to the client.
     if automove is false then a 404 is returned to the client if WebDFS
     cannot find the requested file
-->
    <selfHeal>false</selfHeal>

<!--
      the path that the fileinfo extension will use
-->
    <magicDbPath>/sw/share/file/magic</magicDbPath>

<!--
     this setting will tell WebDFS to disconnect the client
     after key points in propagation of an action.
    
     For example we disconnect the client before continung with replicating
     an uploaded file so that the client will NOT hang on and wait for us to complete
     communication with a completely different node.
-->
    <disconnectAfterSpooling>true</disconnectAfterSpooling>

<!--
     the number of bytes to read when spooling a file to disk
-->
    <spoolReadSize>10240000</spoolReadSize>

<!--
     whether or not to write debug messages to the error log
     this is mostly useful to see the propagation of an action
     between nodes.
-->
    <debug>false</debug>

<!--
     the data portion of the config is the part that is used for mapping objects to nodes
     the data element holds an array of configs where the config located at index 0 is the most current
     config in use and the other configs are prior configs.
    
     some of the reasons you might be adding a new config entry are:
    
     * when you add or remove servers
     * you need to change the weighting between clusters
     * you are changing to new Locator algorithm

            <!--
             The url for THIS node which is mapped to the dfs.php file.
             This can be a direct access or maybe something like an apache rewrite rule.
             This is the url to which all of the PUTs, GETs, MOVEs and DELETEs are sent.

             this is the directory where files will be stored temporarily
             for example, when we are accepting an upload, or when we are getting a file
             from a remote node to fulfill a GET request.

             this is the number iof replicants to make
             this number CANNOT exceed the number of nodes
             in the first cluster of the cluster config below
             the check_reqs.php file will check your config
             to be sure that this value is appropriate

            <replicationDegree>1</replicationDegree>

            <!--
             the clusters config is an array where each element contains
             an array which contains two keys:
                  weight - this is the weight given to this cluster (not a particular node)
                           if you need to weight a single server, then you need to create a
                           cluster for that server alone and give it a weight
            
                  nodes - this is an array of arrays where each nested array represents
                          a server / node / storage system each node structure contains
                          the information necessary for accessing that node in the system.
            
            
                          The characteristics of the value of the 'proxyUrl' element
                          are the same as described above for the 'thisproxyUrl' element
            
                          the static url is a base url for creating static urls
                          for fetching data (doing GET rquests).  this has been added
                          for efficiency sake and does not have to be used.
                          so this means that the getPaths call to the locator class will return
                          two sets of urls,  one will be in the form:
            
                                  http://<domain>/dfs.php/filename
            
                          the others will be in the form:
            
                                  http://<domain>/nn/nn/filename
                                  each n in the url above denotes a single integer
                                  between 0 and 9.  the above urls will represent
                                  a static or direct path to the file
                                  (if you have setup your web server correctly)
