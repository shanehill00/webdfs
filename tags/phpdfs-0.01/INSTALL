Hi,  if you are reading this, then you have decided to download and try the pre-pre-alpha version of phpdfs.
sweet!  thanks for doing that.  below are the instructions on how to get going.  please send all feedback to:

shanehill00<<at>>gmail-com

Basic requirements and extensions:

PHP 5.2.0 (cli version) and greater

http extension
uuid extension
fileinfo extension
pcre extension
filter extension
curl extension

NOTE: something not mentioned below is that you need to start your webserver at some point. :P

The steps for installing and configuring a PHPDFS node follow:

=============
||| QUICK |||
=============

   1. Get the source here:

      http://code.google.com/p/phpdfs/

   2. Unpack the source and make the library/ and conf/ directories available to your php include paths.
      it is not recommended to unpack the source in the web root.

   3. cd into the conf/ directory and copy the cluster_conf.php.dist file into cluster_conf.php
      and open and edit according to the instructions inside the file. This will include creating
      the data directories. You will read about the data directories in the cluster_conf.php file.

   4. cd into the /utils directory and execute the check_reqs.php on the command line.
      Be sure to pass the path to the configuration file as the first parameter.

      For example:

      % /usr/local/php5/bin/php -d include_path='.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php:/Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/library:/Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf' check_reqs.php /Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf/cluster_config.php

      The above line will check the configuration file at /Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf/cluster_config.php for errors.

      The check_reqs.php script will also check that you have all of the necessary extensions available in
      your php environment. if the configs are ok and you created the temp and data directories, you will see
      a message telling you that your configs are OK. if you get any errors, fix the problem and re-run the script.

   5. make the utils/dfs.php file available and executable to the web. via an http config or however you like to do it.

   6. copy the utils/upload.php into your web root and load the upload.php into your browser and start using PHPDFS!


=====================
|||| LONG WINDED ||||
=====================

   1. Download the latest, stable phpdfs source here:

      http://code.google.com/p/phpdfs/

   2. Unpack the source.  This can be unpacked anywhere. However, it is NOT recommended that you unpack
      things in your web root. rather unpack them in an installation directory and symlink to the necessary
      files or copy whatever is necessary to the web root like the dfs.php file.

   3. Configure the include_path to include library/ and conf/ so the PHPDFS libs and configuration file 
      will be found at runtime. This can be done in a myriad of ways.
      For example, in the httpd configuration file, at runtime or as an ENV variable.

   4. Create two directories.  one for storing the files,  the other for storing temp data.
      These two directories should be different and should not lie in the same path.  For example:

          * /var/phpdfs/tmp and /var/phpdfs/data ARE good choices for the temp and data dirs

          * /var/phpdfs/data/tmp and /var/phpdfs/data are NOT good choices
            for the temp and data dirs as they lie in the same path

      You also need to modify the permissions on the temp and data directories
      so that your web server has read and write access to them.

   5. Now you need to configure the node. To do this, cd into the /conf directory
      and copy the cluster_config.php.dist file into cluster_config.php.
      Now open the new cluster_config.php that was just created in a text editor
      and edit the values appropriately.
      Read the file carefully as it will tell you how to set all of the config values correctly.

   6. cd into the /utils directory and execute the check_reqs.php on the command line.
      Be sure to pass the path to the configuration file as the first parameter.

      For example:

      % /usr/local/php5/bin/php -d include_path='.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php:/Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/library:/Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf' check_reqs.php /Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf/cluster_config.php

      The above line will check the configuration file at /Users/shane/dev/phpdfs/conf/cluster_config.php for errors.

      The check_reqs.php script will also check that you have all of the necessary extensions available
      in your php environment. If the configs are ok and you created the temp and data directories, you
      will see a message telling you that your configs are OK. if you get any errors, fix the problem and
      re-run the script.

   7. once the configs are setup and pass all the checks, you will need to make the file utils/dfs.php 
      available and executable to the web. This is the file that acts as the proxy for phpdfs and is
      where all of the PUTs. GETs. DELETEs and MOVEs are sent. There are several ways to map the dfs.php file.
      You can do some sort of mapping in your httpd conf OR sym link to the utils/dfs.php file OR copy the
      utils/dfs.php file into your web accessible directory that will execute php. I am sure you can think
      of other ways,  the point is that the utils/dfs.php file is what executes to start a PHPDFS command

   8. once the utils/dfs.php file is set up and web accessible and executable, you are ready to test the installation.
      To do the test, copy the utils/upload.php file into your web root or some place that will allow you to access it
      via the web. After you have copied upload.php into the appropriate locations just simply access the
      html page and start using PHPDFS!
